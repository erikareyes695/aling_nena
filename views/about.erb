    	<h4>Aling Nena</h4>
    	<p> Emma "Nena" Stone is an American bussiness woman who was born to a poor family in San Francisco. But during her study in college in the University of San Francisco (she was offered a scholarship for her exceptional skills and talents), she fell in love with a handsome Filipino, Andrew Garfield, whom she unexpectedly had a child with. She had to stop going to school because of the pregnancy and had to put up a sari-sari store, supported by Andrew, to meet her and her family's needs.</p>
    	<br />
    	<p>She never returned to college even after when her daughter, Nene, was born. But her business grew rapidly and expanded all over the state. After learning about web developments, she became interested in going online to further expand her business. </p
